# Demo: Google Cloud CI/CD for GKE
This repo demostrates CI/CD for GKE with Google Cloud tools Google Cloud Deploy, Cloud Build, and Artifact Registry. The example app is based on a simple Python Flask example app named "Population Stats" and uses Kustomize overlays to enable configuration differences across three different environments: test, staging, and prod..
